## StudyAID
The project idea is a study aid app for students that would enable them to be able to study effectively. The app will help users prioritize and organize themselves. Users would be able to choose what apps within their phone that they want to be disable for amount of time, so they can focus. This app will let you monitor your phone usage, how much time you are spending on social media apps on daily, weekly and monthly bases. Users will be able to create their own timetable to make sure that the are utilizing all the time available. There will a section where users can keep track of the different activities they need to get down. The users will be able to back up their notes and class hand ups by scanning them using their camera.
